# Task Manager 
## A Python, Flask & mongoDB web application

Task Manager is a web application built to allow users to view items on a to-do list as well as create an account and post items on the to-do list.  Users can also delete their own items once completed so they are removed from the list.  

In addition, an admin view exists which allows 'super user' access and gives the admin the abiilty to manage all posts and create/modify categories.

The site was built as part of the Code Institute Full-Stack developmer course to demonstrate using Python and Flask to HTML content and interact with a mongoDB database, performing all CRUD functions. The live page is deployed with Render.
